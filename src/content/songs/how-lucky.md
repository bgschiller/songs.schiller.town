Today I walked down the street I used to wander
Yeah, shook my hand and made myself a bet
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, how lucky can one man get?
I bronzed my shoes and I hung 'em from a rearview mirror
Bronzed admiration in a blind spot of regret
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, how lucky can one man get?
Today I walked down the street I used to wander
Yeah, scratched my head and I lit my cigarette
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, how lucky can one man get?
Today I walked down the street I used to wander
Yeah, shook my hand and made myself a bet
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, how lucky can one man get?
Hey, how lucky can one man get?
Hey, how lucky can one man get?
