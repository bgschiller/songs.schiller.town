Michael row the boat ashore, hallelujah Michael row the boat ashore, hallelujah

Sister help to trim the sail, hallelujah
Sister help to trim the sail, hallelujah

The river is deep and the river is wide, hallelujah
Green pastures on the other side, hallelujah

Jordan’s river is chilly and cold, hallelujah Chills the body but not the soul, hallelujah

The river is deep and the river is wide, hallelujah Milk and honey on the other side, hallelujah

The trumpets sound the jubilee, hallelujah The trumpets sound for you and me, hallelujah

Michael row the boat ashore, hallelujah Michael row the boat ashore, hallelujah
