Purple Lights
In the Canyon
That is where
I long to be
With my three
Great companions
My backpack, my pony and me.

Whip-poor-will
In the willow
Sings a sweet
melody
For my three
Great companions
My backpack, my pony and me.

Gonna hang
My sombrero
On the limb
Of a tree
Near my three
Great companions
My backpack, my pony and me.

No more cows
To be ropin’
No more sheep
Do I see
Just my three
Great companions
My backpack, my pony and me.
