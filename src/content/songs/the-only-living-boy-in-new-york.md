Tom, get your plane right on time
I know your part'll go fine
Fly down to Mexico
Da-n-da-da-n-da-n-da-da and here I am
The only living boy in New York

Ah, I get the news I need on the weather report
Oh, I can gather all the news I need on the weather report
Hey, I've got nothing to do today but smile
Da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da and here I am
The only living boy in New York

Half of the time we're gone
But we don't know where
And we don't know where

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Here I am

Half of the time we're gone
But we don't know where
And we don't know where

Tom, get your plane right on time (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I know that you've been eager to fly now (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Hey, let your honesty shine, shine, shine now (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da
Like it shines on me (Here I am)
The only living boy in New York
The only living boy in New York


Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Here I am
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Here I am
