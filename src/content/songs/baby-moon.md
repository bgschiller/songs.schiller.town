There’s a wee baby moon,
lying on his back with his funny little toes in air
And he’s all alone in the big blue sky,
But the wee baby moon doesn’t care.

Baby moooon, keep shining on me baby moon.

There’s a wee baby moon,
lying on his back with his funny little toes in the air
And he’s all alone in the big blue sky,
But the wee baby moon doesn’t care.
No, the wee baby moon doesn’t care.
