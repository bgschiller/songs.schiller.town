Out of my window, looking in the night
I can see the barges flickering light
Starboard's glowing green and port is shining red
I can see the barges from my bed

CHORUS
Barges, I would like to go with you
I would like to sail the ocean blue
Barges, have you treasures in your hold
Do you fight with pirates brave and bold?

How my heart longs to sail away with you
As you sail across the ocean blue
But I must sit beside my window clear
As the barges sail away from here

CHORUS

Out of my window looking in the night
I can see the barges flickering light
Taking their cargo out into the sea
How I wish that someday they'd take me

CHORUS
