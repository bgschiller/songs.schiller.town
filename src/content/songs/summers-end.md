Summer's end is around the bend just flyin'
The swimmin' suits are on the line just dryin'
I'll meet you there per our conversation
I hope I didn't ruin your whole vacation

Well you never know how far from home you're feelin'
Until you've watched the shadows cross the ceilin'
Well I don't know, but I can see it snowin'
In your car, the windows are wide open

Just come on home
Come on home
No you don't have to be alone
Just come on home

Valentines break hearts and minds at random
That old Easter egg ain't got a leg to stand on
Well I can see that you can't win for tryin'
And New Year's Eve is bound to leave you cryin'

Come on home
Come on home
No you don't have to be alone
Just come on home

The moon and stars hang out in bars just talkin'
I still love that picture of us walkin'
Just like that old house we thought was haunted
Summer's end came faster than we wanted

Come on home
Come on home
No you don't have to be alone
Come on home
Come on home
You don’t have to be alone
Just come on home
