For each child that's born
A morning star rises and sings
To the universe who we are (3x)

[We are our grandmothers prayers
We are our grandfathers dreamings
We are the breath of the ancestors
We are the spirit of God

We are Mothers of courage
Fathers of time
Daughters of dust
Sons of great visions
We are sisters of mercy
Brothers of love
Lovers of life and the builders of nations

We're seekers of truth
And keepers of faith
Makers of peace wisdom of ages](2x)

We are our grandmothers prayers
And we are our grandfathers dreamings
We are the breath of our ancestors we are the spirit of God

For each child that born
A morning star rises and sings
To the universe who we are(3x)

We are one
