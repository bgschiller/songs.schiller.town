CHORUS
Somos el barco, somos el mar
Yo navego en ti, tu navegas en mi
We are the boat, we are the sea
I sail in you, you sail in me

The stream sings it to the river, the river sings it to the sea
The sea sings it to the boat that carries you and me

CHORUS

The boat we are sailing in was built by many hands
And the sea we are sailing on, it touches every land

CHORUS

So with our hopes we set the sails and face the winds once more
And with our hearts we chart the waters never sailed before

CHORUS

We are the boat, we are the sea
I sail in you, you sail in me
